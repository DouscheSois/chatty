finish routes for comments and likes, finish actions, then finish /wall to list all posts.
i think /wall is still not protected


product reducers -> post reducers.

proxy error, backend problem most likely. check out next time

re work the posts backend and frontend, sample from clone

back route for posts works but its not finding the user for some reason/
try to change the postroute to router.post instead of router.router first/

check wallscreen.js and post.js from components, i wrote the code to GET_ALL_POSTS
but havent tested it yet.

wallscreen.js is succesffully loading the posts on the page from the backend/api.
