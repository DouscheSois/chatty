<h3>Summary</h3>
I built this app because I wanted to build a full stack application and test my skills. It took me a while to figure it and also googling most of the functionality but it worked out in the end. I learned a lot how the whole stack works together. I consider this my first big project and I am proud of the outcome. I know I can do better and will show it on my next application. -->
